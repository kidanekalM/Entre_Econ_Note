Chapter 2____________________Protocols Standards and Architectures___________________________
 Protocol - Set of rules that two (or more) peer entities obey in
             order to communicate
 Protocol Architecture needed b/c data communication is complex
 Layers - Each layer has specific protocols designed and implemented 
  - Adv - Simplify design and implementation 
        - change protocols without changing the whole system
        - can be implemented by different vendors
  - Dis - Sub obtimal design
       - Overhead for each layer
 Layers and devices
  - Layer 1 - Modem, Repeater, amplifier
  - Layer 2 - Switches, wifi access points
  - Layer 3 - Router
 Layers
  Physical l1 - How bits are sent through medium, signaling
              - Twisted pair,optical fiber
  Data Link l2 - Transmission of data over link MAC, Hardware
                 Network Access
                 - Ethernet 
  Network l3 - Allows host to communicate Routing, IP, Internet
             - IP ICMP, OSPF
  Transport l4 - Connect processes on OS of host 
                 Error cont,flow control,congestion
                 - TCP, UDP, SCTP
  Application - Provides finctionality for varius apps
              - HTTP,FTP, SMTP, SSH
 Common Features of protocols
  - Headers are added to carry control information=encapsulation
    - e.g. source,dest
  - Segmentation - divide into chunks
 Origins - ARPANET - US DoD
  - Internet Architecture Board and Internet Engineering Tasks
    Force (IETF) - standardise protocols
  - OSI seven layer architecure is less used than TCP/IP
 Basic steps of message sending
  - Segmentation - break data into smaller packets
  - Header - Add addressing information 
  - Deliver data to network card
 Key elements of a protocol
  - Syntax - Structure or format of data
  - semantics - meaning of each section 
  - Timing - when data sould be sent 
 Characterstix of a protocol are
  - Direct/ Indirect - intermediate exists or not b/n hosts
  - Monolithic/Structured - one single protocol or many
  - Symmetric/assymetric - peer ot peer vs client server
  - standard/nonstandard - specific custom use vs mass use
   - K src L dest = K*L protocols and 2*K*L implementations
 Functions of protocols
  - Encapsulation - inclusion of control information
   - Three types of control information
    - address - sender and Reciever
    - Error detecting code 
    - protocol control - protocol Functions
  - Segmentation and reassembly
   - Break data up into smaller size
   - adv - communication network maximum size 
    - error control may be more efficient
    - more equitable access to shared transmission media
   - dis - all frames must contain control info - Overhead
    - frame arrivals may generate an interrupt
    - more time is spent processing numerious frames
  - Connection control
   - Connectionless services - packets are sent and no ack
    - e.g. UDP
   - Connection oriented - logical association is established
    - long sustained session
    - orderly and timely delivery of packets
    - Contains three phases
     - Connection establishement
     - data transfer
     - connection termination
    - Each side sequentially numbers the frames sent
    - each side can keep track of incomming and outgoing frame
    - sequencing has 3 main functions
     - Ordered Delivery - may not arrive in order of sending
     - Flow control - Reciever controls how many incomming
      frames it can allow before sending 
     - Error control - error detection and retransmission
    - e.g. TCP
  - Addressing 
   - each end system and intermediate system has address
  - Multiplexing
   - when multiple connections use single connection
  - Transmission Services
   - variety of additional serv e.g. Priority, security
   - Stack/Suite - layer of protocols

  - session layer -  synchronization
  - presentation - translation compression encryption

Chapter 3_______________________Internet and Transport Protocols_____________________________
 Internetworking
  Connecting many different types of LAN nad WAN to achieve 
  communication between hosts independet of thier network size
  It is achieved through routers -
  routers: are packet switches that operate at network level
   - can act as source or Destination but mostly intermediate
  IP is the Internetworking protocol
  Features of IP are:
   Datagram packet switching 
   Network layer
   Connectionless
   Addressing
   Fragmentation and reassembly
  IP Datagram
  - Header 20 byte might vary
  IP Datagram Fields 
   Version [4 bits]: version number of IP; current value is 4 (IPv4)
   Header Length [4 bits]: length of header, measured in 4 byte words
   DiffServ [6 bits]: Used for quality of service control
   ECN [2 bits]: Used for notifying nodes about congestion
   Total Length [16 bits]: total length of the datagram, including
    header, measured in bytes
   Identification: sequence number for datagram
   Flags: 2 bits are used for Fragmentation and Re-assembly, the
     third bit is not used
   Fragment Offset [13 bits]: See Fragmentation and Re-assembly
   Time To Live [8 bits]: datagram lifetime
    - how many routers a datagram should pass before discarded
   Protocol [8 bits]: indicates the next higher layer protocol
   Header Checksum [16 bits]: error-detecting code applied to header
    only; recomputed at each router
   Source Address [32 bits]: IP address of source host
   Destination Address [32 bits]: IP address of destination host
   Options: variable length fields to include options
   Padding: used to ensure datagram is multiple of 4 bytes in length
   Data: variable length of the data
  IP routing - finding best path for datagram
   - Routing Table - destination and next node address
   - Routing protocols - find best path,clct status info, update table
  IP Fragmentation and reassembly
   Might fragment into smaller datagrams
  IP Addresses 
   IPV4 (32Bit)
    Has network(subnet) and host portion
    Subnet mask-Identify where the IP address is split classless/classful 
     classless - 32 bit 1 indicate network part 0 indicate host
   Special IP addresses
    Network address - has host portion full of zero only subnet 
    Directed broadcast address - has host portion full of 1s
    Local broadcast address - has host portion full of 1s-id all hosts 
    Loopback - identify current host aka localhost first 8 011111111
    startup source address - identify current with no address
   Obtaining an IP address 
    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority:manages IP assignment
    IANA delegates to regional and regions to nations
    Dynamic Host Config Protocol- automatically assign IP addresses
 Application layer protocols
  HTTP,FTP,SMTP,SSH,Telnet
  support protocols - DNS,DHCP/BOOTP,NTP
 Transport layer protocols (TCP/UDP)
 Internet Protocol and Addressing
 Internet Applications
  client/server mostly used internet app 
  Transport Protocol - implement many methods common to all apps
   Transmission control Protocol- most widely used
    Stream oriented
    Connection oriented
    Full duplex
    Flow and error control 
    Conjestion control
    TCP segment: has 20 byte header fields incude:
     Source and Destination port number
     sequence number of first data byte ISN
     Acknkowledgement number
     Header length
     Window - number of bytes reciever is acceptiog
     Checksum - error detection
     Urgent Pointer
     Options
    Flags 
     CWR congestion Window reduced
     EcE explicit congestion notification echo
     URG - segment carries urgent data
     ACK - segment carries Acknkowledgement
     SYN - synchronize
     FIN - no more data to send
     RST - Rest the connection
    Three way handshake
     -   A                       B
         |                       |
         |---------SYN---------->| 
         |                       |
         |<-------SYN/ACK--------| ACK=ISNA+1 SYN=ISNB
         |                       |
         |---------SYN/ACK------>| can carry data
         |                       |
    Speed of Data Transfer Depends on
     Flow control
     Error control
     congestion control
   Protocol number - identify Transport protocol used by both hosts
    e.g. 6-TCP
  Five addresses uniquely identify end-to-end communications
   1. Source IP
   2. Destination IP
   3. Protocol number
   4. Source port
   5. Destination port
  Port Numbers - 16 bit numbers - identify specific app 
   well known ports 0 - 1023 registered 1024 - 49151 Dynamic -65535
