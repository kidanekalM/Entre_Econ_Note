Basics of Economics     
    # Definition of economics
        "There is no universally accepted definition of economics, because different economists defined economics 
         from different perspectives."
         "Economics is a social science which studies about efficient allocation of scarce resources so as to attain 
          the maximum fulfillment of unlimited human needs."
         "economics is a science of choice, it studies how people choose to use scarce or limited productive resources
          to produce something"
        Key points
         * Study about scarce resources
         * Study about allocation of resources;
         * Allocation should be efficient;
         * Human needs are unlimited
         * Study how to satisfy the unlimited human needs 

    # The rationales of economics
        The two fundamental facts 
            * Human ("society's") material wants are unlimited
            * Economic resources are limited ("scarce").
        - Study How we make choices to use the scarce resources ( Decision Making)
        - Study How various choice s outcome based on Efficiency , Equity , Stability  


    # Scope and method of analysis in economics
        # Scope of economics
            the core of modern economics is formed by its two major branches:             

            "Microeconomics" 
                 concerned with the economic behavior of individual decision making
                 Studies "individual" economic units of an economy.
                 Its central problem is "price determination" and "allocation of resources".
                 Its main tools are the demand and supply of "particular" commodities and factors
                 Concerned with how the "equilibrium" of "a consumer", "a producer" or "an industry" is attained

            "Macroeconomics" 
                 deals with the effects and consequences of the aggregate behaviour of all decision making 
                 Studies an economy as a "whole" and its "aggregates"
                 Its central problem is determination of "level of income" and "employment".
                 Its main tools are "aggregate" demand and "aggregate" supply of an economy as a "whole"
                 Concerned with the determination of "equilibrium" "levels of income" and "employment" at "aggregate level".
        
        #  Positive and normative analysis
            The two perspectives of economics are :

                "Positive Economics" 
                    Concerned with analysis of facts and attempts describe the world as it is 
                    It does not judge a system as good or bad, better or worse
                "Normative Economics"
                    Evaluates the desirability of alternative outcomes based on ones value judgments about what is good or what is bad 
                    It is loaded with judgments 
                    It is a matter of opinion Since What is good for one may not be the same for others
                    Any disagreement can be solved by voting  

        # Inductive & Deductive Reasoning in economics 
            The two methods of logical reasoning :
                
                "Inductive reasoning" 
                    A logical method of "reaching" at a "correct general statement" from several "independent" and "specific correct statements".
                    Deriving theory by moving from "facts" to "theories" and from "particular" to "general" economic analysis. 
                    It involves :
                        1. Selecting problem for analysis
                        2. Collection, classification, and analysis of data
                        3. Establishing cause and effect relationship between economic phenomena.
                "Deductive reasoning"
                    A logical way of arriving at a particular or specific correct statement starting from a correct general statement.
                    It involves :
                        1. Problem identification
                        2. Specification of the assumptions
                        3. Formulating hypotheses
                        4. Testing the validity of the hypotheses
                    
        # Scarcity, choice, opportunity cost and production possibilities frontier
            The central purpose of economic activity :
                - Production of goods and services to satisfy consumers needs and wants
                - To meet peoples need for consumption both means of Survival & satisfy ever growing demand for improvised lifestyle

            1."Scarcity" :
                refers to all economic resources that are required to produce goods & services are finite or limited  
                it reflect the imbalance of wants & the means to satisfy the wants 
            
                "Resources" 
                    "Free resources" - available amount > the amount needed 
                    "Scarce (economic) resources" - available amount < the amount needed  
                        Land - natural resources & usable for the production of goods & service. # Reward : Rent
                        Labour - efforts of human being for the production of goods & service. # Reward : Wage
                        Capital - manufactured inputs for the production of goods & service # Reward : Interest
                        Entrepreneurship - special type of human talent that help us organize the production of goods & service # Reward : Profit

                "Shortage" is a specific and short term problem but "Scarcity" is a universal and everlasting problem
            2."Choice" :
                Since economic resources are scarce , we can not satisfy all our wants. Therefore "Choices must be made".
                we are forced to make a choice on what to produce, in what quantity & what not to produce 
                Scarcity implies Choice , & Choice implies Cost  
                
            3."Opportunity Cost" :
                A decision to have more of one thing, at the same time, means a decision to have less of another thing , so 
                "opportunity cost" is the amount or value of the next best alternative that must be sacrificed (forgone) in order to obtain 
                one more unit of a product. 
            4."The Production Possibilities Frontier or Curve (PPF/ PPC)" :
                "(PPF/PPC)" -a curve that shows various possible combinations of goods and services that we can produce
                    (PPF/PPC) describe 3 important concepts
                        1. concept of scarcity 
                        2. concept of choice 
                        3. concept of opportunity cost

                    Opportunity_cost = |Change in sacrificed good / Change in the gained good|

            5."Economic Growth and the PPF" 
                - Economic growth is represented by outward shift of the PPF 
                - A shift of the PPF along the Y- axis or X-axis is called "asymmetric growth"  


            Scarcity → limited resource → limited output → unable to satisfy all our wants → choice involves costs → opportunity cost

    # Basic economic questions / Central economic problems
        "What to produce"?
            problem of allocation of resources
            decide which good to produce & in what quantities   
        "How to produce"?
            problem of choice of technique
                labour-intensive techniques 
                    the use of more labour relative to capital, per unit of output
                capital-intensive techniques
                    the use of more capital relative to labour, per unit of output
        "For whom to produce"?
            problem of distribution of national product
            relates to how a material product is to be distributed among the members of a society    

    # Economic systems
        is a set of organizational and institutional arrangements established to answer the basic economic questions
        
        # Capitalist economy
            * the oldest economic system 
            * all production are privately owned , takes place by individual private Entrepreneurs who works for private Profit

        # Command economy
            - socialistic economy 
            - The economic institutions that are engaged in production and distribution are owned and controlled by the state
            Features of Command Economy

    # Decision making units and the circular flow model
        * The three decision making units in a closed economy or Economic agents
          closed economic : if a country does not have economic interaction with other countries
            1.(Household)
                "A household can be one person or more who live under one roof and make joint financial decisions"
                    a= Selling of their resources, and
                    b= Buying of goods and services
            2.(Firm)
                "A firm is a business organization that uses economic resources to produce goods and services"
                    a= Buying of economic resources
                    b= Selling of their products.
            3.(Government)
                "A government is an organization that has legal and political power to control or influence households, firms and markets.
                They also provides some types of goods and services known as public goods and services for the society."

        * These 3 agents interact in two markets
            - Product Market
                * It is a market where goods and services are transacted/ exchanged
                * Households and governments buy goods and services from business firms.
            - Formal Market (input Market)
                * owners of resources (households) sell their resources to business firms and governments.
        
                * The (circular flow-diagram) is a visual model of the economy that shows how money (Birr), economic resources and 
                  goods and services flows through markets among the decision making units.

Theory of Demand and Supply
    # Theory of demand
        - Demand, means the desire of the consumer for a commodity backed by purchasing power.
        The two essensial factors are 
            * a consumer is willing to buy but is not able to pay, his/ her desire wont be demand
            * consumer has the ability to pay but is not willing to pay, his/ her ability to pay wont be demand
        'Law of Demand'
            price of a commodity and its quantity demanded are inversely related 
            when price rise the demand for that commodity will decrease

        # Demand schedule (table), demand curve and demand function
            [Demand Schedule] 
                - If the list of prices and quantities purchased at those prices are known. 
                - It states the relationship between price and quantity demanded in a table form.
            [Demand Curve]
                - 'Demand curve is a graphical representation of the r/ship b/n d/t quantities of a commodity demanded by an individual
                  - at different prices per time period.
            [Demand Function]
                - is a mathematical r/ship b/n price and quantity demanded, all other things remaining the same.
                    Qd=f(P) where Qd = quantity demanded & P = price of the commodity

                    Qd = a + bP , b = slope  /this_will_be_the_demand_function

                    b = AQ / AP  Change in demand / Change in Price 
            [Market Demand] 
                - The market demand schedule, curve or function is derived by horizontally adding the quantity demanded for the product 
                   - by all buyers at each price
                    Q = a + bP , ==>  demand_function = Q * Qm (Total No. demands) 

        # Determinants of demand
            - It is influenced by many factors like
                1. 'Price of the product'
                        when price increase(decrease) , demand decrease(increase)
                2. 'Taste or preference of consumers'
                        When the taste of a consumer changes in favour of a good, her/his demand will increase and
                        the opposite is true
                3. 'Income of the consumers'
                        <Normal Goods> are goods whose demand increases as income increase, while 
                        <inferior goods> are those whose demand is inversely related with income
                4. 'Price of related goods'
                        <Substitute goods> are goods which satisfy the same desire of the consumer.
                            eg. tea & coffee , pepsi & coca 
                        <Complimentary goods> are those goods which are jointly consumed.          
                            eg. car & fuel , tea & sugar                   
                5. 'Consumer expectation of income and price'
                        Higher price expectation will increase demand while a lower future price expectation will
                        decrease the demand for the good
                6. 'Number of buyer in the market'
                        Since market demand is the horizontal sum of individual demand, an increase in the number of buyers 
                        will increase demand while a decrease in the number of buyers will decrease demand.

                [Changes in demand]: a change in any determinant of demand—except for the goods price causes the demand curve to shift.
                        [ 2 - 6 ] are called demand shifters 


        # Elasticity of demand
            - Elasticity is a measure of responsiveness of a dependent variable to changes in an independent variable
            -'Elasticity of demand' 
                * refers to the degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price, or change 
                  in income, or change in prices of related goods. 
                * is unit free because it is a ratio of percentage change
                * is usually a negative number because of the law of demand
                * If the price elasticity of demand is positive the product is 'inferior'

                1. <Price elasticity of demand>
                    * degree of responsiveness of demand of consumers to change in price.
                    * If |E| < 1, demand is inelastic and the product is necessity
                    * If |E| > 1, demand is said to be elastic and the product is luxury product
                    * If |E| = 1, demand is unitary elastic 
                    * If |E| = 0, demand is said to be perfectly inelastic

                      #Determinants of Price elasticity
                        1. The availability of substitutes:
                        2. Time:
                        3. The proportion of income consumers spend for a product:
                        4. The importance of the commodity in the consumers’ budget:

                2. <Income elasticity of demand>
                    * responsiveness of demand to change in income 
                    * If |Eid| < 1,(positive) the good is necessity good
                    * If |Eid| < 0,(negative) the good is inferior good
                    * If |Eid| > 1, the product is luxury product

                    [ Visit the module for the formulas]>
                    

                3. <Cross-price elasticity of demand>
                    * Measures how much the demand for a product is affected by a change in price of another good.
                    * If |Exy| is (positive) the good is substitute good
                    * If |Exy| is (negative) the good is Complimentary good
                    * If |Exy| is (zero) the good is unrelated good                                                            


    # Theory of supply
        - Supply, refers to the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to 
            - offer for sale at various prices during a given period. 
        'Law of Supply'    
            as price of a product increase, quantity supplied of the product increases, 
            and as price decreases, quantity supplied decreases
             
        # Supply schedule, supply curve and supply function
            [Supply schedule]
              - tabular statement that states the different quantities of a commodity offered for sale at different prices
            [Supply curve]
              - same as Supply schedule but it shows the information graphically rather than in a tabular form. 
            [Supply Function]
                Qs=f(P) where Qs = quantity supplied & P = price of the commodity
                Qs = a + bP , b = slope  /this_will_be_the_supply_function

            [Market Supply]
              -  curve or function is derived by horizontally adding the quantity supplied for the product by all sellers 
               - at each price

        # Determinants of supply
            - It is influenced by many factors like
                1. Price of inputs ( cost of inputs) :
                2. Technology :
                3. Prices of related goods :
                4. Sellers expectation of price of the product :
                5. taxes & subsidies :
                6. number of sellers in the market :
                7. weather, etc.


        # Elasticity of supply
            -'Elasticity of supply' 
                - It is the degree of responsiveness of the supply to change in price
                    1. <Price elasticity of supply>
                        * It can be elastic, inelastic, unitary elastic, perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic

                            [Chech the module or the pdf for their formulas]
                    
                    * |Es| < 1 , inelastic 
                    * |Es| > 1 , Elastic
                    * |Es| = 1 , Unitary elastic
